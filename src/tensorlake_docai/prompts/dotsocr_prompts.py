DOTSOCR_LAYOUT_PROMPT = """Please output the layout information from the PDF image, including each layout element's bbox, its category, and the corresponding text content within the bbox.

1. Bbox format: [x1, y1, x2, y2]

2. Layout Categories: The possible categories are ['Caption', 'Footnote', 'Formula', 'List-item', 'Page-footer', 'Page-header', 'Picture', 'Section-header', 'Table', 'Text', 'Title'].

3. Text Extraction & Formatting Rules:
    - Picture: For the 'Picture' category, the text field should be omitted.
    - Formula: Format its text as LaTeX.
    - Table: Format its text as HTML.
    - All Others (Text, Title, etc.): Format their text as Markdown.

4. Constraints:
    - The output text must be the original text from the image, with no translation.
    - All layout elements must be sorted according to human reading order.

5. Final Output: The entire output must be a single JSON object.

# 1. Define the System Role (Crucial for 9b models to stay on task)

FIGURE_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT = (
    "Task: Classify this figure into ONE of these categories.\n\n"
    "Definitions:\n"
    "- BARCODE: Barcode, QR code, or data matrix. horizontal or vertical\n"
    "- CHART: Data visualization (graphs, plots) with axes/legends.\n"
    "- DIAGRAM: Flowcharts, relationships, or labeled schemes.\n"
    "- TABLE: Multi-row data grid with pre-filled content for reading. Contains multiple rows of data, NOT empty fields.\n"
    "  *KEY*: If the image has a REPEATING GRID structure (rows × columns like a spreadsheet), it's a TABLE even if some cells are empty.\n"
    "- FORM: Document containing *labeled* input fields (lines/boxes) meant for user input. Must show clear structure.\n"
    "  *KEY*: Forms have INDIVIDUAL labeled fields, NOT a multi-row grid. If it looks like a spreadsheet/table grid, it's a TABLE.\n"
    "- OTHER: Photos, illustrations, icons, stamps, signatures.\n"
    "  *IMPORTANT*: Use OTHER for blank images, white space, random noise, or isolated lines with no text.\n"
    "  *IMPORTANT*: Use OTHER for blurry, skewed, or unreadable images.\n\n"
    "Decision Logic:\n"
    "1. Check for Quality: If the image is blurry, heavily skewed, or text is unreadable -> Output OTHER.\n"
    "2. Check for Content: If the image is mostly empty, blank, or has no text/labels -> Output OTHER.\n"
    "3. Grid Structure Check: If it has a REPEATING row × column grid structure (like a spreadsheet) -> TABLE.\n"
    "4. Visual Data Check: If it has bars, lines, points, pie slices, or axes with plotted data -> CHART.\n"
    "5. Text Grid Check: If it's rows/columns of text WITHOUT graphical elements -> TABLE.\n"
    "6. Input Fields Check: If it has labeled INDIVIDUAL input fields (not a grid) -> FORM.\n\n"
    "Output ONLY the category name."

    "   - Direction: Detect language. Arabic/Hebrew -> `graph RL`. English -> `graph LR`.\n"
    '   - Syntax: You MUST wrap ALL node text in double quotes (e.g., id["Content"]).\n'
    "4. Handling Visuals/Decorations:\n"
    "   - IF there are unconnected icons, footprints, or illustrations: IGNORE THEM.\n"
    "   - Do NOT describe them. Do NOT write a 'Note' about them.\n"
